# MatrixRowReducer
This is a simple Python program which reads a matrix from Input.txt, and outputs its respective Row Reduced Echelon Form.
It can do this for a matrix of any length or width, so long as you format the input correctly.

This program has been tested to function using IDLE and PyCharm.

The correctness of the program was primarilly judged using the website https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/linear-algebra/reduced-row-echelon-form-rref-calculator/ as a correct source.
